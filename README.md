# Lanky Tracker: The Next Generation

This program/website is a tracker for the video game *Donkey Kong 64* that you can use to track your progress in said game. It was originally made for ROM hacks that were made using the [Donkey Kong 64 Randomizer](https://dk64randomizer.com/), but should work for the original game, too.

This is an updated version of a tracker originally written by Wolfman2000 and linked on [the DK64 Randomizer's wiki](https://dev.dk64randomizer.com/wiki/index.html?title=Trackers#lanky-tracker) as an example of a tracker you could use with games generated by the Randomizer. Alex, the author of this tracker, really enjoyed using the original Lanky Tracker, but on or by August 17, 2025, it disappeared, apparently as a result of Wolfman2000 disappearing from GitHub. While mirrors of the tracker exist, all are just as badly outdated as the original Lanky Tracker, so Alex has taken it upon himself to make this updated version, intended to be correct as of the latest version of [the DK64 Dev Randomizer](https://dev.dk64randomizer.com) and account for the new features introduced since the original tracker was made.

The instructions on how to use this thing can be found in "instructions.html".

As with the original, this tracker was written in JavaScript, primarily with an [electron-vite](https://electron-vite.org/) setup in addition to Facebook/the Meta Group's [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Obviously, you need JavaScript in order to use it.

## Known Bugs and Stuff Alex Needs to Do for Future Versions:
- Fix npm-web-out.yaml so that "instructions.html", its CSS, and the Lanky head icon all get pushed out to the gh-pages branch...I put them in there by hand, but the next run of that file takes them all away again.
- Implement the B. Locker barriers in some way.
- K. Rool's phase selector will only light up in yellow if you have all five phases set and one of them is Tiny Phase without Feathers or Mad Jack without Ponytail Twirl. Alex was unable to fix this while updating the K. Rool selector to account for the "use K. Rool phases as bosses" option in the Randomizer. Since all regulation "season" seeds that Alex has seen on YouTube (going back to Season 2) have only three phases, must fix this.
- Make the left side of the tracker sticky...either Alex really sucks at using the "position: sticky;" CSS command, or something else about the tracker's design is stopping it from being sticky.
- Having Snide turned off in the "Moves" section makes all Kasplats unavailable. This, obviously, is a stupid way to check whether or not you can turn in Blueprints for a seed, since most Randomizer seeds are highly unlikely to have them on Kasplats...must find a better way to implement Snide.
- Changing the "Slam level required for Chunky phase of K. Rool" also changes what level of Simian Slam you have in the moves section...must separate these two. Likely related, the Chunky phase checker currently only checks to see if you have a Slam at all, and not what level of Slam it is.
- The Banana Medal checks may not have been properly updated to account for whether Climbing is required for them or not, and Alex probably poorly implemented the Isles Medals.
- When grouping by regions, the new checks that weren't in the original Lanky Tracker don't show up...must find what went wrong there.
- Change the progressive Slam settings to account for the fact that you can now customize how progressive they are as of the Version 5 Dev Randomizer.
- Make it so that the tracker doesn't get wider when you set Fungi Forest time to dusk...instead, make it so that the tracker is wide all the time.
- Alex took out the "Region Hints" section of the original Tracker because he thought it was poorly done, as well as the "Location Shuffle Settings" section of the settings...should reimplement both somehow.
- Need an easy way to reset the tracker if need be.
- Since Alex redesigned this tracker, the Dev Randomizer came out with a new feature called "half medals"...should probably implement this. For now (until Alex has a chance to play/view on YouTube a seed with the feature active), just assume that a half medal requires half the Colored Bananas you need for a full medal, rounded to the nearest whole number (so, 38 for a half medal in the original game).

## Unlikely Features
- As with the original, if there is a way to enable autotracking with the underlying languages, it's not known at this time, so this car is only available with a manual transmission.
- Alex also took out the "presets" dropdown underneath the Switchsanity settings, and will probably NOT re-implement this.
